    "# Worksheet 1 - Introduction to Python\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of the session you will (hopefully!):\n",
    "- Know what a program is\n",
    "- Know what a programming language is\n",
    "- Know what Python is\n",
    "- Know what Jupyter is, and how to use it to write simple computer programs\n",
    "- Know where to find information regarding installing Python onyour own machine\n",
    "- Understand what a data type is\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a computer program?\n",
    "FYI: program == programme (we use both spellings; usually just program!)\n",
    "A program is just set of instructions that tells the computer what to do. Everything a computer does is done by writing and running computer programs. This includes all applications such as Microsoft Word, Spotify and Steam, and also web browsers such as Safari and Firefox. Further uses of computer programs include\n",
    "- Machine learning and artificial intelligence\n",
    "- Data analysis\n",
    "- Video games\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a programming language?\n",
    "A computer programming language is a language used by humans to write a list of instructions (a program) to tell a computer what to do. All programs like Safari and Firefox are written by humans using a computer program. Examples of computer programming languages are: Python, C, C++, Fortran, Matlab, Mathematica, and many others\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Python?\n",
    "Python is a particular programming language. In this part of the module we will use Python to create lists of in-structions to tell the computer what to do. This is called a Python program. Python is installed by downloading it from the internet as a package; most commonly as part of a distribution called [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution). The method of installation may vary depending on if you're running Windows, Mac or Linux. Anaconda is commonly used because it comes pre-packaged with a number of useful tools and editors for writing and running python scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've installed Anaconda you'll notice in the launcher that there are a number of programs you can choose and launch -- the two we're interested in are **Jupyter Notebook** and **Jupyter Lab**. The two are very similar, both allowing you to write and run python code within your internet browser, but I'd recommend **Jupyter Lab** if it's available as it has a few more useful features. It's also possible to launch these programs from the command line by entering either `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab` (don't worry if this doesn't mean anything to you, the launcher method should work for you still!). The big advantage of writing python with jupyter is that the output of your code can be saved and shared with others to look at, and you can show text, code and outputs alongside each other in a single document (like this one)."
