At its most basic level, an integral is the area under a curve and that is what we shall calculate.\n",
    "\n",
    "We wish to approximate this integral when we have a discrete set of points rather than continuously. As a first approximation, we evaluate the function $f$ at fixed, equally spaced points, ($x_0, x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_N$) where the x location can be defined $x_k = x_0 + k_h$, where $h = \\frac{1}{N}\\left(x_N − x_0\\right)$ is the interval size. Figure 1 shows an example function $f(x)$ divided into equal intervals. Each interval approximates the value of the integral as piecewise constants. Then we can approximate the integral of the function as a sum of the areas of the rectangles, namely the base times height:\n",

    "There are other, sometimes better, methods to approximate integrals. These methods have varying degrees of accuracy for different types of functions. In this section we consider a very useful approximation method called the Trapezium Rule or the Trapezoidal Rule. The Trapezium rule approximates the function $f(x)$ as a piecewise linear function rather than a piecewise constant function, and hence approximates the integral as a sum of the areas of the trapezoids thus formed.\n",
