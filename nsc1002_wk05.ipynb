    "\n",
    "Goals:\n",
    "- To write Python programs that accept simple inputs from the User;\n",
    "- To know what SciPy and NumPy are.\n",
    "- To understand what a function is;\n",
    "- To be able to write and use your own Python functions; You should ensure that you have completed all exercises before the next workshop\n",

    "## Accepting user input from the terminal\n",
    "To accept user input from the terminal you need use the function input. To demonstrate this, type the following into your editor:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "d = input(\"Please enter a number between 1 and 10: \")\n",
    "print(f\"You typed in the number {d}\")\n",
    "print(type(d))\n",

    "## Introduction to NumPy and SciPy\n",
    "NumPy and SciPy are modules written specifically for performing mathematical and numerical operations. NumPy (Numeric Python) provides powerful, fast ways of handling large multidimensional arrays and matrices of numeric data. SciPy (Scientific Python) extends NumPy with additional functionality, including some standard algorithms. In this workshop we’ll be working with NumPy. To include NumPy and SciPy routines in your programs you use the key word import. There are many ways to use the import key word but the two main ways we will do so is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy\n",
    "or\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you access NumPy functions, you will be required to type: `numpy.<functionname¡` or `np.<functionname¡` For example, if you wanted to use NumPy’s function for the mean of a sequence, you would use the syntax `numpy.mean()`. If you import numpy the second way, you would refer to it as `np.mean()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the important aspects of NumPy is its ability to create and manipulate arrays, including multidimensional arrays, which we shall study later this term. A NumPy array can be created from a list shown below\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "a = np.array([1, 2, 4, 7])\n",
    "b = np.array([1, 2, 4, 7], float)\n",
    "print(b)\n",
    "print(type(b), type(b[2]))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will produce the following output: `[1. 2. 4. 7.] <class ’numpy.ndarray’> <class ’numpy.float64’>`\n",
    "\n",
    "What will it produce for ?\n",
    "- `print(a)`\n",
    "- `print(type(a), type(b[2])`\n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous ways to create numpy arrays: look up the following numpy functions using a search engine:\n",
    "1. `a = np.arange([start,] stop, [step,] dtype=None)`: This function returns an array, $a$, of evenly spaced values in an interval defined by start and stop. \\<start> and \\<step> are optional\n",
    "(default are 0 and 1 respectively)\n",
    "2. `a = np.ones(N)`: This function will return an array of size $N$ filled with ones. This is useful for initialisation!\n",
    "3. `a = np.random.rand(N)`: This function will return an array of size $N$ filled with random numbers over \\[0, 1). This is useful for initialisation!\n",
    "4. `a = np.zeros(N)`: This function returns an array of size $N$ filled with zeros. Also useful for initialisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy array elements can be accessed just like Python lists: indexed, sliced, and manipulated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a function\n",
    "In programming, we often need to repeat sections of code many times. Python, and other programming languages, have the capacity to treat such sections of code in a special way so they can be easily repeated. In some programming languages these are called subroutines. In Python they are called _functions_.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a collection of statements that performs a task.\n",
    "- Allows us to combine multiple statements into one instruction.\n",
    "- Can allow us to repeat and modularize sections of code.\n",
    "- Python has a number of inbuilt functions. Examples include: `abs()`, `print()`, `str()`, `int()`, `range()`...\n",
    "- NumPy has a collection of functions we can use to manipulate\n",
    "arrays. Examples include: `np.arange()`, `np.mean()`, `np.zeros()`..."

    "## Appendix: What is a namespace and why is it important when using functions?\n",
    "The concept of a namespace is used widely in computer programming because it assigns collections of names (variables, function names, etc) to a specific parts of a program. Some examples:\n",
    "- You can use the function `print()` in any part of your program because that function belongs to any program written in the Python computing language.\n",
    "- The function `array` is part of numpy and is only available though `numpy.array` or `np.array` (depending on how you first initialized numpy).\n",
    "- A local namespace is created when a function is called. This local namespace allows you to define variables in the function that are not seen in other parts of the program. For example, if we assign the variable $b = 2$ in a new function, our `main()` routine would not recognise that variable. We shall look at examples in the workshop exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "This concept is important when programming because variables with the same name can be defined throughout a program, but knowing that functions have their own local namespace makes it clear that variables defined within a function live only within that function. This helps to write clear, reproducible code, and also helps with debugging.\n",
