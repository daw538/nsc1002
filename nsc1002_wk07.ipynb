    "## Working with Files\n",
    "The common pattern for working with external files in Python is to open the file, perform some actions, and then close the file. To open a file in Python, we use the open() function, which returns a _file object_. This file object is a an identifier that will be used to interact with the file (reading, writing, closing, etc). To begin, let's start by opening a file, doing nothing to it, and closing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "myf = open(\"MyDataFile.txt\", \"w\")\n",
    "myf.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few things to notice. The open function takes two arguments: the first is the name of the file you want to open. The second is the mode. To get more information, type open? in the console, but in brief the most commonly-used modes work like this:\n",
    "- `'w'`: write: opens the file and lets you write to it. Erases anything currently in the file.\n",
    "- `'r'`: read: opens the file and lets you read data in, but not modify anything.\n",
    "- `'a'`: append: opens the file, keeping what's in it. Lets you write onto the end of the existing information.\n",
    "- `'r+'`: readwrite: lets you read and write. Doesn't delete anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second line of code closes the file. Notice that we close the file by using the file identifier and a little dot, with the close() function added to the end. This style of working with files makes it simpler to keep track of what we're doing if we have several files open at once. \n",
    "\n",
    "Open your working directory in Python and create a file called `MyDataFile.txt`. Then open the file in an editor and check that it's empty. Opening a file in Python to write will create it if it doesn't exist. Opening a file to read will return an error if it doesn't exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Writing\n",
    "We will also want to write new files. We can write to a file with the write method. This works similarly to the read which we'll get to in the next section: you use the file identifier with the dot, with whatever you want written as the argument, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "myf = open(\"MyDataFile.txt\", \"w\")\n",
    "myf.write('Hello , World!')\n",
    "myf.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now try opening your file and look at what's in it. Let's write a program to write numbers to a file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "myf = open(\"MyDataFile.txt\", \"w\")\n",
    "\n",
    "for i in range(10):\n",
    "    myf.write(\"{}\".format(i))\n",
    "    myf.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we needed to cast our variable i to a str using the format statement. This is because _file I/O only works on strings_ – trying to write anything else will give you an error. Open your file and look at it. Notice how everything is all bunched together? That's because we didn't tell the computer to put any new lines in and it did exactly as we told it. Just like the numbers or letters you want in the file, the formatting has to be there as well. Computers store the point where you start a new line using a special character called a newline character. In Python we write it as `\\n`. When you open your file in an editor, it will use these `\\n`'s to know when to start new lines, and it doesn't print them otherwise. Let's modify our code to print everything onto a different line.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "myf = open(\"MyDataFile.txt\", \"w\")\n",
    "\n",
    "for i in range(10):\n",
    "    myf.write(\"{}\\n\".format(i))\n",
    "    myf.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The inclusion of `\\n`'s wherever you want a new line to start is just another pattern that you get used to. There are other special characters used for formatting as well, but we won't talk about them further in this workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading\n",
    "Reading from files can get complicated. Let's consider the simple case with data written in lines. You access this data with the `readline()`method. For example, let's re-use our `MyDataFile.txt` file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "myf = open('MyDataFile.txt', 'r')\n",
    "line = myf.readline()\n",
    "print(line)\n",
    "myf.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "See how it gave us back the first line? You might also note that we got an extra blank line. This is because we read in the entire line newline character and all, and Python's `print()` function always tacks its own newline onto the end. So, we printed with two newlines. Each call to readline reads the next line in the file. If there are no more lines, it returns `None`. So let's use a loop to print each line (and not worry about the extra blank lines for now).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "myf = open('MyDataFile.txt', 'r')\n",
    "while True:\n",
    "    line = myf.readline()\n",
    "    if not line:\n",
    "        break\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(line)\n",
    "f.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There's another method called readlines() This reads each line and puts them all into a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "myf = open('MyDataFile.txt', 'r')\n",
    "\n",
    "data = myf.readlines()\n",
    "print(data)\n",
    "myf.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes this is the best choice. But if you have a big file, or you don't need every single thing in the file, it might not be. It can be more efficient to loop over the file and do things line by line, or to create a big list and operate on it. Knowing which option to take comes with practice!\n",
    "\n",
    "The big thing to take away here is how to open and close files. A lot of the time you will be using a special module, like csv for commaseparated data or _re_ for regular expressions which will have their own way of reading and writing"

    "## Modules\n",
    "We've already briefly discussed and used modules, but we revisit the idea here because we'll be working with a new module, below. Familiar modules are Numpy and Matplotlib. Practically speaking, a module is a way of grouping a block of code together for easy reuse elsewhere. Consider that when you started out you wrote simple\n",
    "scripts of a few lines. Once these got too big, you started organising them into functions to make things clearer and easier to work with. As your programs get bigger, it becomes a good idea to organise your code into different modules. Another big advantage of modules is that they're portable if well-designed enough. For example, the module Numpy, which we have already been using, includes many data types and functions that scientists and engineers want to use. As natural scientists, you need to work with modules, so you import the Numpy module and make use of high-quality code that someone else has already written and tested, without having to write it all from  cratch yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules make the Python language easy to extend to different applications. As a reminder, to get access to a module, you use the key word import. There are a couple of options for how you use it. Let's use the example of the Numpy module.\n",
    "- `import numpy`: Gives you access to everything in Numpy, prefixed with the name numpy.\n",
    "- `import numpy as np`: Does the same as the above, but uses the name 'np' instead of 'numpy'. This is very commonm and saves typing.\n",
    "- `from numpy import *`: the * means 'all'. Gives you access to everything in Numpy, but without a name prefix like 'np'. This is dangerous and almost never a good idea.\n",
    "- `from numpy import sin`: Imports only the sin() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a good idea to keep the name of the module there. This prevents different functions or constants which may be defined in different modules from clashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Useful Modules\n",
    "There are a lot of useful modules in Python. You're familiar with Numpy and (hopefully!) Matplotlib. We'll learn Pandas today. A few others worth being aware of are:\n",
    "- time: routines for timing and optimising algorithms\n",
    "- logging: logging, status, and error handling\n",
    "- pickle: serialising Python data\n",
    "- os: interfaces with the operating system\n",
    "- sys: system-specific parameters and functions\n",
    "- csv: working with comma-separated (e. g. like Excel) files\n",
    "- tkinter: used for making GUIs\n",
    "- beautifulsoup: HTML/XML parser\n",
    "- pygame: used for making 2D games in Python\n",
    "- xarray: used for manipulating climate model outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "You can Google python modules to find out more, and how to use them. This is one of the advantages of being connected to the international Python community – shared software. There are many more modules, so it pays to have a look around to see what's out there before starting on your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Matplotlib Quick Refresher\n",
    "Matplotlib is probably the most used and the most useful module for plotting in Python. You learn it by doing, and by consulting the builtin documentation and online documentation. Here is an example. Make sure you follow all the lines in this code before moving on.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "# Typying plt? in ipython will give you some basic information\n",
    "about legends.\n",
    "a = np.arange(0,10, 0.5) # What does this line do?\n",
    "b = a **2\n",
    "#now plot a against b:\n",
    "plt.figure(1) # initialize the figure\n",
    "plt.clf() # empty the contents of the figure\n",
    "plt.plot(a, b, 'b-', label = 'a vs b')\n",
    "#now plot something different\n",
    "plt.plot(a, b**1.5, 'r--', label = 'a vs b^1.5')\n",
    "# Type plt.legend? to give some information about legends\n",
    "plt.legend(loc = 'best') # lets Python choose the best location for the legend\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "Much, much more is possible. In particular, you will find the use of subplots within a figure is very useful. But let's move on.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Pandas Module\n",
    "Pandas is a very useful module for working with data. Today we'll\n",
    "work with it briefly, but you may well use it in the years to come.\n",
    "Numpy may still be your workhorse for this course, especially when\n",
    "you have already got the data into your code, but Pandas will prove\n",
    "useful to you in the future, for example if you do some serious experiments in a lab. The techniques we learned above for reading and\n",
    "writing files work fine for simple files, but Pandas lets you work with\n",
    "more complicated data sets, like those that lab instruments will give.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas introduces a new data structure called a _DataFrame_ (just like how Numpy has its own specialised data structure called an array). A DataFrame is a grid-like structure where each row represents an item and each column is some attribute of that item. (Users of Microsoft Excel, SPSS, or R will have seen something similar before.) Pandas can read various file types like csv, Excel, SQL, HTML, etc. We'll work with csv, or comma-separated value, files today. To read these, use the `read_csv` command from the Pandas module: `pandas.read_csv(filename)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's make a simple script to read in some csv data and figure out the type of the structure we create. We'll also print some information. This uses the census.csv file from ELE -- to run the following sections of code download it and save it to the same directory as this notebook."

    "See how the type of this structure we've created is a `DataFrame`? Having good data structures is probably the most important thing for writing good programs (at least according to Linus Torvald, the man who wrote Linux). This type is really well-suited to working with data, just like arrays are good for numerical computations and lists are good for times when you need a flexible collection of objects. The `.head()` method just returns the top few lines of the DataFrame object it belongs to (which we've called census here), which is useful for seeing what sort of stuff you're working with. There is also a `.tail()` method which gives you the last few lines. Accessing bits of a DataFrame is done the same way as with other data structures: with square brackets. In this case, however, you don't use an integer index. Rather, you use the string which corresponds to the name of the column. For example, let's print all the 2011 data:"
