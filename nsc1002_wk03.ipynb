    "# Worksheet 3 - Loops, Algorithms & Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this session you will:\n",
    "- Know what an algorithm is\n",
    "- Write several algorithms using python scripts that use conditionals and loops\n",
    "- Discover how to write and run python scripts using Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "As usual, if you have any questions during this session please ask. You should complete all the exercises before next week.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Remember: you learn by doing! The best way to learn Python or any computer language is by writing programs!_\n",

    "## Jupyter Intro üßë‚Äçüíª\n",
    "Hopefully by this point you will have been given a short introduction and demonstration of [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org \"Jupyter Website\"), either using **jupyter notebook** or **jupyter lab** (I recommend **jupyter lab**). Both can be launched easily from the Anaconda Launcher you should already have installed on your machine. The file you have just opened is known as a jupyter notebook (you'll see they have .ipynb in their filename rather than .py for a normal python script). In each notebook you can write text and run code in the same place (and much more); each block of text or code is stored in a separate 'cell', and this allows you to run single blocks of code separately should you wish.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to edit text, it's as easy as double clicking on this cell and the editor will appear. To confirm your changes you can click run cell (‚ñ∂), or even easier, `shift+enter` on the keyboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's exactly the same for code. Enter your code and use `shift+enter` or ‚ñ∂ to run that cell of code. To add a new cell, you can click ‚ûï or use `shift+enter` (if you are at the end of the notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the other useful buttons are listed here:\n",
    "- ‚ñ∂ - Run selected cell\n",
    "- ‚èπ - Interrupt kernel (stops selected cell)\n",
    "- üîÅ - Restart kernel (this resets the notebook and all stored variables)\n",
    "- ‚è© - Fast-forward (runs all code forward of that point)\n",
    "- üíæ - Save notebook (it should auto-save each time you run code, but just to be safe!)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're using **jupyter lab** you will be able to view different notebooks in tabs similar to your web browser, as well as a file sidebar on the left-hand side of your notebook. You can use this to upload and organise any files you might want to you along with your python script.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of this notebook is simply a different version of the pdf worksheet you will have already been given. The advantage is that this notebook will show you the text of the document with the example outputs shown alongside. At the end there are instructions and space for you to add your own code for the exercises given at the end of the worksheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the day how you code is entirely up to you, I imagine some people will form a preference for either Spyder or Jupyter, so use whatever you prefer. Note though, that at the end of this semester you may find in NSC1004 you will be asked to use Jupyter in a lab session, so hopefully this will prepare you well! üòÄ\n",

    "## Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops are methods used to repeat a block of code. There are two main types of loops, _for_ loops and _while_ loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. `for` loops\n",
    "`for` loops are used when the number of repetitions is known. A `for` loop has the following structure:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for <iterator> in <iterable>:\n",
    "    indented statements\n",
    "    more indented statements\n",
    "pass # end of loop; note the end of indentation also (this line is optional)\n",
    "more lines of code after loop\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The iterator is a dummy variable, typically an index, whose value sequentially takes on the values of the iterable. The iterable is typically a range of numbers (e.g. 1 to 100) but can be something more general such as a list of items. For the loop to run correctly, there are two rules you **must** follow:\n",
    "1. You must use a colon `:` at the end of the `for` statement (similar to if you were writing an `if` statement.\n",
    "2. Loops must be _indented_, normally by four spaces. The end of the loop is marked by the end of the indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes people will write `pass` at the end of a for loop without indentation as a helpful marker however this is optional. The most important part is the end of indentation. See the following example:"

    "If we write a code to find the square root of $x$, we are using a simple algorithm since we are searching for the solution to the equation $y\\times y-x=0$. There can be many different kinds of algorithms to accomplish the same task. Choosing which one to use will have to do with aspects such as efficiency, accuracy, and readability. For example, consider the following method to compute an approximation to the square root of $x$.\n",

    "Exhaustive Enumeration or 'brute force search' is a general (but often very inefficient!) method of finding the solution to a problem. For the problem of finding the square root of $x$, we begin with a guess, change it by a small amount, check, and continue until it‚Äôs close enough. Here is demonstration code from the class reference book (_Introduction to Computation and Programming using Python, by John Guttage_, Figure 3.3) that finds the square root of $x$ using exhaustive enumeration:\n",
