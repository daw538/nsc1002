    "# Worksheet 6 - More About Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Goals: To better understand the utility of functions in Python, and how to use them. Specifically:\n",
    "- To understand the difference between the point of definition of a function and the point of invocation;\n",
    "- To have a better understanding of how functions work within a Python program;\n",
    "- To have practice using multiple functions in a Python program by working with root-solving algorithms\n",

    "## Python code is a Sequence of Instructions\n",
    "Python code is a sequence of instructions that is processed one line at a time. The Python language starts in the left-most column of the first line and processes the instruction from left to right. As Python executes the instructions on each line, the point of execution normally moves downward, one line at a time. An example of this is in the code below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"\"\" This program adds two numbers together \"\"\"\n",
    "x = 2.\n",
    "y = 2.\n",
    "z = x + y\n",
    "print(f’The value is {z}’)\n",
    "```\n",
    "If Python encounters key words, such def for functions, it expects indentation to mark the block of code that belongs to the function. This is where the function is defined, but the execution of the function will come later, where it is 'called' or 'invoked'.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two key concepts\n",
    "1. There is a point of definition where the function is defined.\n",
    "2. There is a point of invocation where the function is invoked (or \"called\").\n",
    "\n",
    "These two concepts are demonstrated in Figure 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"invoke_labelled.png\" alt=\"Figure 3b\" width=\"600\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### The point of definition of a function:\n",
    "The **point of definition** of a function is where the function first appears. More generally, the key world def indicates to Python that a function is being defined. When Python encounters this keyword, it expects the block of indented code just beneath the definition statement to be associated with that function. When the function is defined, the arguments that immediately follow the function name are called **formal** arguments. In the example, the formal argument is $x$. The definition of the function terminates when Python either encounters the key word **return** or there are no more statements in the indented block of code to execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The point of invocation of a function\n",
    "The **point of invocation** of a function is anywhere in the program where a function is used. In our example, the point of invocation is actually in the print statement! When Python encounters the function being called, the **actual** arguments are bound to the **formal** arguments. In the example, the actual argument is $y$, and has been initialised to have the value 42.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "There are two types of function in common usage in Python: a **lambda** function and a regular function, or just a function. Lambda functions are one line functions, while regular functions are more powerful and, in fact, much more common. We’ll be focusing on regular functions in our work today.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a regular function (see also Figure 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# First we define the function:\n",
    "def add_five(x):\n",
    "    \"\"\"This function takes an input argument\n",
    "    called x, creates a new local variable z\n",
    "    by adding 5 to x then returns the result.\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    z = x + 5\n",
    "    return z\n",
    "pass\n",
    "\n",
    "# And now we invoke it:\n",
    "y = 10\n",
    "z = add_five(y) # This is the point of invocation!\n",
    "# The value of z should be 15.\n",
    "print(f'z = {z}')\n",
    "# It works!\n",
    "```"
