In the next sections we will explore two additional algorithms to advance our experience with loops, conditionals, variables, and lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Root finding algorithms\n",
    "The idea of root finding algorithms is to solve the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F\\left(x\\right) = 0.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, if we are interested in finding the square root of a number $x_0$ with the answer being $x$ then we are interested in,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x_0 = \\sqrt{x} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "and thus the equation we're trying to solve with a root solver is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sqrt{x} - x_0 = 0, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "therefore\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F\\left(x\\right) = \\sqrt{y}-x=0.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, if we square each side of the initial equation we can alternatively write this,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F\\left(x\\right) = y-x^2 = 0. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Refering to the initial equation, we can test this equation by looking at a familiar example: in the case where we are searching for the square root of 4, $y$ is 4 and $x_0$ is 2. If we were searching for the square root of 5, then $y = 5$ and $x_0$ is the unknown number we're going to compute with an algorithm."

One of the best ways to get started making a flow chart is to write what you know at the top of a piece of paper (these variables may need to be initialized) and what you want at the bottom.

Draw circles around groups of processes that are connected. This is illustrated on the left side of the figure below. Use lines and arrows to show yourself where they fit into the 'flow' of the algorithm. Once you have a good idea, redraw the flow. This is illustrated on the right side of the figure. Do this until you have sketched the flow of the algorithm. There are many ways of developing and writing the same algorithm, be creative in how you think about it.\n",

A collection of more closely related steps are circled in red, and you can see they must fit in between the what is known, and what you want at the end (the square root of $x$). The sketch on the right is a refinement of the one on the left. The idea is to modify the sketch until you can clearly see each step of the algorithm.\n",
